# Master Of Time (BtW's Addon)


## Presentation
Tired of having to sleep during the night or to use addons like Progressive Item Speedup (https://github.com/BTW-Community/Progressive-Item-Speedup-Addon) or Nightmare Mode (https://github.com/elmi2305/Nightmare-Mode-CE-3.x) for their world speeding feature to test redstone contraptions and farms ? 

Well... i got you covered !

**The Master Of Time Addon** lets you fully control the flow of time, might it be speeding it up or even slowing it down, yes, you heard it right, you can now slow down the game at will !

You can slow down the game up to 0.025x ! (damn that's slow)

However your speeding capability depends on your pc, in some case some pc can't even speed up beyond 2x or at all... (but it's possible to go beyond 20x with a very good pc)

This Addon is mainly meant for creative mode usage such as redstone testing, mid-long term testing of certain farms
It's *possible* to use it in gameplay but at **your own risk** !

## How to use

The closest you get to the extremes in term of speed (very low or very high speed) the less stable and more difficult it is to interact with the world, to counteract the movement issues, **i heavily recommend  using**  to move around with "less" impact on the movement (the slower the speed the longer you have to press a movement button to actually work)

To use this addon you needs to use commands:
- "/worldspeed set {number}" : let you decide which speed you want your game to run at
- "/worlsdpeed reset" : reset the world speed at 1x
- "/worldspeed speedtest" : let you know the current speed of the game (the higher the speed the less accurate it is)
- "/worldspeed maxpspeedtest" : let you know the highest speed your pc could handle (can vary a lot depending on a lot of factor so it should be taken lightly, but it's a good indicator to know around which value your game can run)

You can also use the keybind "R" to reset the world speed in case you can't type in the chat
