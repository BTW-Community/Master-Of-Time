## Presentation
Tired of speeding up the time by sleeping or by using addons like [Progressive Item Speedup](https://github.com/BTW-Community/Progressive-Item-Speedup-Addon) or [Nightmare Mode](https://github.com/elmi2305/Nightmare-Mode-CE-3.x) for their world speeding feature to test redstone contraptions and farms ? 

Well... i got you covered !

**The Master Of Time Addon** lets you fully control the flow of time. Might it be speeding up, slowing down, or even freezing the world, it is up to you.

However your speeding capability depends on your pc, in some case some pc can't even speed up beyond 2x or at all... (but it's possible to go beyond 20x with a very good pc)

This Addon is mainly meant for **creative mode** usage such as redstone testing, mid-long term testing of certain farms. But you could use commands in survival as well if you enable cheat.

It is a server side addon, so if you make a server with it, players don't have to install it.

## How to use

The closest you get to the extremes in term of speed (very low or very high speed) the more difficult it is to interact with the world.
To counteract that, it is possible to make the player unaffected by time speed (with the /tick playerAffected command).

To use this addon you can use commands:
- "/tick rate {number}" : let you decide which speed you want your game to run at
- "/tick freeze" : freeze the world but not the player (beware can be a bit janky)
- "/tick reset" : reset the world speed at 1x
- "/tick speedtest" : let you know the current speed of the game (the higher the speed the less accurate it is)
- "/tick maxspeedtest" : let you know the highest speed your pc could handle (can vary a lot depending on a lot of factor so it should be taken lightly, but it's a good indicator to know around which value your game can run)
- "/tick keybinds <upSpeedKey|downSpeedKey>" : let you decide the value at which the world speed will be set when the associated keybind is pressed
- "/tick playerAffected <true|false>" : let you decide if the player should be affected by changed time flow (the player is not affected when the game is frozen regardless)

Or keybinds *(only if cheats are enabled)*:
- R = Reset the world speed to 1x
- G = Increase the world speed to 10x (can be modified using command)
- V = Decrease the world speed to 0.25x (can be modified using command)
- F = Freeze the game
- N = Resume the game for one tick when the game is frozen

(BEWARE: this addon can cause freezes, and bugs. Please report it in the BtW discord server at the Master Of Time addon showcase channel if you have any issue)
